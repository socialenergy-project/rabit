# README

This repository is the Research Algorithm Toolkit, developed in the context
of the Horizon 2020 SocialEnergy project http://socialenergy-project.eu/. 

The purpose of this module is to allow administrators or priviledged RAT users
to evaluate the performance of different pricing algorithms, on the portfolio
of the SocialEnergy userbase.

The portal is available at https://rat.socialenergy-project.eu.

In order to be able to run the algorithms, you need to install the 
"pricing algorithms" submodule 
https://bitbucket.org/socialenergy-iccs/pricing_algorithms, 
in a directory subdirectory of this repo, with the default name.

Ensure that the submodule is installed correctly, by following the instruction
in the corresponding README file
